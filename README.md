This repository houses nanostructure files (CIF) of Molybdenum Ditelluride featuring pit defects that I have prepared for my Molecular Dynamics (LAMMPS) project. One figure of such nanostructure is given below. In this accompanying visual representation, Molybdenum atoms are denoted in blue, while Tellurium atoms are depicted in red. Explore the contents to gain insights into the unique characteristics and properties of this material.
